# jsproj_grape-prosperity


Winemaking is a relatively complex science. Over the last thousands of 
years, many factors have drove certain grapes to be grown in specific regions. 
What I would like to do within this JS Data Visualization, is take as many of
these factors and create a searchable API where you can visual the different 
environmental influences on grapes (and winemaking) across California.

Within this Data visualization I provide searchable functions where you can
specify how different environmental factors help certain grapes thrive within
different climates and regions. These statistics include, but are not limited to,
rainfall, soil-type, temperature range, elevation, and daily cloud cover (sunlight).

In the future I would love to implement other tradition influences on wine-making
as a searchable function (amphora usage, kvevri fermentation, as well as
amaro, aromatized high sugar content wines) within the tags.
