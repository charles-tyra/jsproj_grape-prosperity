# *~**grape-prosperity**~*


Winemaking is a relatively complex science. Over the last thousands of 
years, many factors have drove certain grapes to be grown in specific regions,
either due to social - or environmental - pressure.  What I would like to do
within this JS Data Visualization, is take as many of these factors and
create a searchable API where you can visual the different  environmental
influences on grapes (and winemaking) across California.

Within this Data visualization I provide searchable functions where you can
specify how different environmental factors help certain grapes thrive within
different climates and regions. These statistics include, but are not limited to,
rainfall, soil-type, temperature range, elevation, and daily cloud cover (sunlight).
This information can hopefully provide insight regional patterns on areas
where specific grape varietals thrive

In the future I would love to implement other tradition influences on wine-making
as a searchable function (amphora usage, kvevri fermentation, as well as
amaro, aromatized high sugar content wines) within the tags for more historical patterns.
