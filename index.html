            this is where i'm thinking about getting a bagel and eating it and 
            mostly being happy with my life and the plan of what it could be (but i
            would also love for my data pull to work generally). taking a poll on what
            i should order from the bagel place today: charles, probably a focassia
            true sandwich - probably not exactly what it could have been if there
            were real gluten within the sandwich. oh you know what sounds real good?
            a chicken parm with extra cheese on those subway subs. all of what is written
            here should really make it to the end of the page by now, and hopefully it has.
            update: giant breakfast burrito
